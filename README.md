### Data Architecture

#### Google Sheets Integration
The platform uses Google Sheets as its primary database, providing several advantages:

**Data Structure**
```
campaigns!A:CZ - Main campaign data with 70+ columns including:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Core Campaign Info (id, name, platform, status, pricing)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Influencer Details (contact, channel URLs, follower counts)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Schedule Management (meeting, submission, and live dates)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Content URLs (plan, draft, and published content links)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Payment Information (pricing, forms, payout status)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Analytics Data (impressions, performance metrics)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Administrative Fields (notes, internal tracking)
```

**Real-time Data Flow**
1. **Read Operations**: Google Sheets API fetches live data on every request
2. **Write Operations**: Updates are immediately written back to Google Sheets
3. **Data Validation**: TypeScript interfaces ensure data consistency
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API failures or missing data

**Authentication Methods**
- **Service Account**: Server-side authentication for write operations
- **API Key**: Read-only access for public data (fallback method)
- **Automatic Detection**: System automatically chooses best available method

#### Campaign Status Management
Sophisticated workflow engine with 15+ distinct states:

```typescript
Campaign Lifecycle:
not_started ‚Üí meeting_scheduling ‚Üí meeting_scheduled ‚Üí 
plan_creating ‚Üí plan_submitted ‚Üí plan_revising ‚Üí 
draft_creating ‚Üí draft_submitted ‚Üí draft_revising ‚Üí 
scheduling ‚Üí scheduled ‚Üí payment_processing ‚Üí completed
```

**State Transitions**
- **Automated**: System-triggered transitions based on user actions
- **Manual**: Admin-controlled status updates for special cases
- **Validation**: Business logic ensures valid state transitions only
- **Audit Trail**: All changes tracked with timestamps and user attribution
